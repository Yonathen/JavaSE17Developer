# Introduction
- is a standard package of Java SDK
- This package is useful as it provides
  - Collections like ArrayList, HashMap, Set
  - StinTokenizer for string operations
  - Utility classes for event model handling
  - Date and time operations
  - Enumerations
  - more

# Collections Framework
- Provides various interfaces that includes several methods
  - to perform different operations on collections

## Collection Interface
- Root interface of the collection framework hierarchy
- Java does not provide implementation of Collection interface
  - but provides implelentations of its subinterfaces like
    - `List`, `Set`, and `Queue`
### List Interface
- An orderd collections that allows us to added and remove elements like an array

### Set Interface 
- Allows us to store elements in different sets similar to set in maths
  - Can not have duplicate elements

### Queue Interface
- Used when we want to store and access elements in FIFO manner

## Map Interface
- Allows elements to be stored in key/Value parirs
- Keys are unique namest that can be used to access a particualr element in map
  - Value is associated with each key

## Iterator Interface
- Provides methods that can be used to access elements of collections

# Date and time operations

# String operations
